Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system by mass. Assume both Earth and Jupiter are moving in circular orbits around the Sun, with their orbits in the same plane. Treat the Sun, Earth, and Jupiter as point masses, ignoring the gravitational influence of other celestial bodies in the solar system, and assume the gravitational attraction between Earth and Jupiter is negligible at times. Let the masses of the Sun and Jupiter be $m_s$ and $m_j$, respectively, and the gravitational constant is $\mathrm{G}$. The radii of the orbits of Earth and Jupiter around the Sun are $r_e$ and $r_j$, respectively. At a certain moment, let the angle between the line connecting Earth and the Sun and the line connecting Jupiter and the Sun be $\theta$. If, at this moment, the Sun’s mass suddenly becomes zero, find the magnitude of the velocity of Earth relative to Jupiter $v_{ej}$ and the minimum speed $v_0$ needed to prevent Earth from being captured by Jupiter’s gravitational force.


**Solution**
From


$$\frac{\mathrm{G}m_sm_e}{r_e^2}=m_e\;\frac{v_e^2}{r_e}\;,$$


we obtain


$$v_e=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{G}m_s}{r_e}}\;.$$


Similarly,


$$v_j=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{G}m_s}{r_j}}\;.$$


From the geometric relationship, we know


$$\begin{align*}
    v_{ej}&=\sqrt{v_e^2+v_j^2-2v_ev_j\cos\theta}\\
    &=\sqrt{\bigg(\frac1{r_e}+\frac1{r_j}-\frac{2\cos\theta}{\sqrt{r_er_j}}\bigg)\mathrm{G}m_s}\;.
\end{align*}$$


To prevent Earth from being captured by Jupiter’s gravitational force, the following condition must be met:


$$\frac12mv_0^2-\frac{\mathrm{G}m_jm_e}{r_{ej}}=0\;,$$


which gives


$$v_0=\sqrt{\frac{2\mathrm{G}m_j}{\sqrt{r_e^2+r_j^2-2r_er_j\cos\theta}}}$$
